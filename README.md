# Credit Risk Analysis

# Overview
Predict credic card risk using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub.

# Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

1. **NAIVE RANDOM OVERSAMPLING

⋅⋅⋅ The classifier is correct only 65% of the time, which is not a good prediction, but is not the worst neither.

⋅⋅⋅ This model only predicts 'High Risk' credits with a precision of 1% and a recall of 72%. Combining both numbers, this is not a good model.

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅

PRECISION: total of 50 people were predicted to have cancer. Of the 50, 30 people actually had cancer. The precision is therefore 30/50, or 0.6.

RECALL(Sensitivity): is a measure of how many people who actually have cancer were correctly diagnosed.

# Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
