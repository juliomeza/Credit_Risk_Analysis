# Credit Risk Analysis

# Overview
Predict credic card risk using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub.

# Results

**1. Naive Random Oversampling
   - The classifier is correct only 65% of the time, which is not a good prediction, but is not the worst neither.
   - Since we are only focusing in the 'High Risk' predictions, this is not a good model with a precision of 1% and a recall of 72%.

PRECISION: total of 50 people were predicted to have cancer. Of the 50, 30 people actually had cancer. The precision is therefore 30/50, or 0.6.

RECALL(Sensitivity): is a measure of how many people who actually have cancer were correctly diagnosed.
